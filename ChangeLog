	* all: Restructured the code. Now there are src/ and doc/ and
	examples/ directories.

	* all: Converted it to use automake and autoconf. I don't really
	check for portability with autoconf, so most of the configure
	script's effort goes to waste, but it does provide some
	compatibility and a lot of usability.

	* all: Moved the whole thing into Darcs version control.

	* all: Fixed the code so that it will compile.

	* gram.y: Discontinued use of the yacc sources for the parser. I
	just ran Bison on them and called the resulting files part of the
	source. The output from Bison is already littered with ridiculous
	amounts of compatibility code anyway, so I figure it's about a
	million times more portable than any other part of the code.

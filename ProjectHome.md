Converts Boolean logic expressions like `out = a & !b | c` into a truth table. This can be used for all sorts of useful things:

  * Preparing input to [espresso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_heuristic_logic_minimizer) for logic minimization. I've put this up for download as well.

  * Converting arbitrarily tangled logic expressions into a simpler form.

  * Making a truth table when you need one for some reason but you're too lazy to do it yourself.

This program was originally written at Berkeley in the early 80s, but I've resurrected it and converted it to a form that will compile and work out of the box on Linux.
